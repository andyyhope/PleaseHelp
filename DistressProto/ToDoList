    TO DO

##############################################

AllViews
- Enlarge the text

Passcode from mainscreen (passcode enabled)
- Include (X) unsuccessful attempt limit with (X) minute lockout
- I created a timer in one of the first early prototypes, it should be in AndyyPrototypes folder somewhere
- I tried doing this but i have no idea where instructionLabel gets its values from lol.

Option View Controller 
- Message View is broken, i think it has something to do with the iOS Version #ifdef, cannot call [self ] methods from within

Appearance/UI
- use a #define for all the [UIColor whiteColor]
    forgot why i was doing this...
    -- was to make all colour options within the app to be in one file i believe
    

Source Code
- Tidy up all source code with correct spaces, indentations etc...
- Enter comments for all methods
- Remove uneccessary code


##############################################

    COMPLETED
    
##############################################

All Views
- Remove any reference for ios5 iphone versions. 

App Delegate
- Location string: where street name says "(null)", replace with empty string
- Call cycle, figure out why it isnt working
- implement loop counter, ie. reached the end of the cycle.
- ###### IMPORTANT ######
    The Contacts plist needs to come from the AppDelegate,
    At the moment you have the MainContactViewController hosting this information for table rows. Ive created a temporary workaround by copying the methods into App Delegate, but you may need to check them to have a look.
    (Call me and i can explain it better)
    Note: This seems to be working now, but the code is a bit untidy perhaps?


Passcode From Main Screen (Enabled)
- Label which displays passcode hint

Passcode Settings
- When user clears passcode it will clear recovery hint
- error handle - recovery hint, user has to enter a value

Main View
- Start using items.plist data instead of hardcoded arrays
- Contact images not showing

ContactAddViewController
- Add place holders
- format number string to remove spaces, ie "0421 121 212" - Cannot make calls when the number has spaces
- Error handle - if nuRll value and save is selected then put a red astericks next to field with a note saying it needs to be filled - possibly a notification from navbar - photo is not needed, however needs to show the default profile image here


ContactEditViewController
- Adjust navbar and remove the 'Cancel' and '+' when it should only have the back button for saving.
- Back Button no longer saves.
- format number string to remove spaces, ie "0421 121 212" - Cannot make calls when the number has spaces

CallingViewController
- fix label not showing

Settings Contact View
- Replace buttons with custom graphics
- Refresh the uitableview when going to add a new record - to stop error images on new records
- Any contact that is imported without an image, use the default_profile_image.gif file
    // Changed to defaultProfile.png + @2x
- When importing a contact from AddressBook, show the ContactEditViewController, with all the fields imported, and highlight "Relation"


Appearance/UI
- Create a custom class for all the buttons
- use a #define for all the [UIColor whiteColor]
- Set a tintColor for UIBarButtonItem
